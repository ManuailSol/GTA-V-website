### About my project - 
GTA-V is a video game that is played on consoles
- Xbox 
- Ps4/5
- Pc 

Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either a third-person or first-person perspective. Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the open world.

### My design process

- Colour
  - I got my imagine from GTA-V website front page and used the colours from that image.
  - The website i got the colours for this is [**colourexplorer.com**](http://www.colorexplorer.com/imageimport.aspx)
