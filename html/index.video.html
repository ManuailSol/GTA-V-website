            GTA V's Los Santos, which previously appeared in San Andreas, is based on the real city of Los Angeles, California. Countless landmarks have been replicated in-game to give the city a more authentic look, including one that won't be around in the real world for long.

            GTA 5 received its R18+ rating for "High Impact Drug Use" while its themes, language, sex, violence and nudity were marked as having strong impact.

            Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either a third-person or first-person perspective. Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the open world.

                  The definition of grand theft auto is to take someone else's car, without permission and with the intent permanently or significantly to deprive the owner of it. The offense is a type of auto theft. In many states, it can be charged as a felony offense that carries more than a year in prison.

                    GTA 5 and GTA Online operate on the same engine, yet the two games are noticeably different in their core gameplay. The most obvious difference is how GTA Online is a multiplayer game, and GTA 5 is a single-player game.

                      What is bad about GTA V? Parents need to know that Grand Theft Auto V is an M-rated action game brimming with gang violence, nudity, extremely coarse language, and drug and alcohol abuse.
